# surveyspec 0.1.0

First release of 'surveyspec', extracting survey specification functions from 'iNZightTools' to make these methods more accessible. This is not a first release, and instead will be modified based on advice and input from others. Once the syntax has been sorted out to something that will remain, I'll release version 1.0.0.
